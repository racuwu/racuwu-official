Welcome to the official website repository of the Rotaract Club of Uva Wellassa University! Managed by the dedicated Web Team of the Public Relations and Digital Services avenue, this open-source project invites everyone to contribute and help make the website better.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- **Git**: Version control system to manage and track changes to your code. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime to run your development server. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- **npm**: Node package manager, which comes bundled with Node.js. Alternatively, you can use **yarn**, **pnpm**, or **bun**.

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/racuwu/racuwu-official.git
cd racuwu-official
```

### Install Dependencies

Next, install the dependencies required for the project:

### Run the Development Server

Now, run the development server:

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
